# AD-CogNet

GitHub repository for the code accompanying my MSc in Computational Biology thesis. The project is being carried out at the School of Informatics of the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM). 

## Data 

For this work, the demographical and neuropsychological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was employed. These datasets are available at the [ADNI website](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) upon formal request. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found in the following [link](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_List.pdf).
